"usage":
	To use it as an replacement for wifi , for example
		PORT1 = SIM800('PORT1')
		This will replace wifi !

	Note :
		There are some case that must be noticed :
			User add SIM800 block in there code :
				Dot will receive , reset and connect to GPRS , it will RESET !
			User delete SIM800 block
				Dot will still be connecting via GPRS until reset
			User didnt plug in the module or the module is not working
				Dot will wait for the module for 60s , then , it will delete user_code and reset !

	Code :
		Really sorry those who find the library not so Pythonic , it have to be sacrified because
			micropython heap fragmentation ( 40k of available memory , only 10k is consecutive)
			when importing a module , a memory block = size of that library must be allocated , therefore , library limited at 8K
			this will utilize alot of trick to get it down in size !
