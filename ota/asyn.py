# asyn.py 'micro' synchronisation primitives for uasyncio
# Test/demo programs asyntest.py, barrier_test.py
# Provides Lock, Event, Barrier, Semaphore, BoundedSemaphore, Condition,
# NamedTask and Cancellable classes, also sleep coro.
# Uses low_priority where available and appropriate.
# Updated 31 Dec 2017 for uasyncio.core V1.6 and to provide task cancellation.
